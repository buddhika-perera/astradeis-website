// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What training is required to operate the Astradeis drone?",
    answer: "We provide comprehensive training packages that cover basic operations, advanced flight patterns, maintenance, and emergency procedures. Most operators achieve proficiency within 2-3 days of hands-on training."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the battery last and what is the charging time?",
    answer: "Our standard battery provides up to 55 minutes of flight time. Charging from empty to full takes approximately 90 minutes with our fast-charging system, which means you can maintain continuous operations with just two battery packs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can the drone operate in rainy or windy conditions?",
    answer: "Yes, our aircraft are designed for field operations in challenging conditions. With an IP54 rating, they can operate in light rain and dusty environments. They can handle wind speeds up to 12 m/s (26 mph), making them suitable for most operational scenarios."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of warranty and support do you offer?",
    answer: "We provide a standard 2-year manufacturer's warranty covering all hardware defects. Extended warranty options are available. Our support team offers 24/7 technical assistance, and we maintain a global network of certified repair centers."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your drones compliant with aviation regulations?",
    answer: "Yes, our drones are designed to meet international aviation standards. They come equipped with necessary safety features like geofencing, automatic return-to-home, and ADS-B receivers. We also provide regulatory compliance guidance for different countries."
